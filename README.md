# ObscuRay

This is the lightweight GUI program for VLESS.

## Info

`profiles.json` and temp `obscuray-config.json` stores your VLESS links (UUIDs, keys, etc.).\
**Do not upload it to a public repository.**\
It uses a system proxy by default.

- Profiles: %appdata%/ObscuRay/profiles.json
- Logs: %appdata%/ObscuRay/app.log
- Cache: %appdata%/ObscuRay/cache/

Currently only for Windows. If I get my hands on it, I'll do it for Linux.
